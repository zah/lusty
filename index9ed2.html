<p>
The Law Office was founded in 1995 by Penka Nachkova. We offer to both our Bulgarian and foreign clients a comprehensive legal service in pre-court and court representation, defence litigation and arbitration proceedings. We are dedicated to providing legal advice and services in the key areas of real estate law, civil law, conventional lien, administrative law, family law, commercial and company law, international law and European community law. The company also offers a full range of administrative legal services to its customers – individuals, legal entities and other organisations. 
The law office is associated with Polikar & Partner in Berlin, Germany. We build effective partnerships with other law companies and proficient specialists in related fields, such as real estate brokers, architects, financial advisors, accountants, translators and interpreters.
We endeavour to provide our clients with an individual approach, loyalty and reliability. 
Our working languages are Bulgarian and English, but we also collaborate closely with skilled translators and interpreters allowing us to work in many other languages.
</p>

<p>
RESPONSIBLE We are proud of our ability to listen to our clients’ requests and to understand and meet their overall expectations and needs. Whether we plead in court, draft a contract, provide advice or respond to a phone call, we strive to react promptly and competently.
</p>

<p>
CREATIVE We place strong emphasis on building partnerships and work closely with our clients to achieve their goals and use their full potential. It is important for us to keep informed of the latest changes in the areas we operate in, and to be able not only to outline the overall picture to our customers, but also to provide them with a detailed view of the issue.
</p>

<p>
PROACTIVE We believe in a proactive approach, cooperating with clients to draft a plan that will work, and striving to find solutions which give our clients choices. We aim to arrive at a reasonable and mutually acceptable decision and reach an out-of-court agreement.  If the compromise however is not a desired outcome, or the dispute cannot be worked out, our track record in representing our clients’ interests in court more than speaks for itself.
